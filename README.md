**Aethel Project**

## **3\. Core Concept**

"The Flickering Flame of Aethel" is a narrative-driven 2D platformer where players embark on a journey through a world torn by ancient conflicts, experiencing events from the viewpoints of three different protagonists: a Human spy, an Angel princess, and a Demon prince. Each character's path will intertwine with the overarching lore of Aethel, revealing different facets of the world and its secrets.

## **4\. Characters**

Each character possesses unique racial attributes (prototype stats) that influence their combat, exploration, and interaction styles.

### **4.1. Peter Thane**

* **Race:** Human  
* **Role:** Spy of the Human Empire  
* **Prototype Stats:**  
  * **ATK (Attack):** 10 (Balanced)  
  * **ITL (Intellect):** 10 (Balanced, useful for espionage and problem-solving)  
  * **AGI (Agility):** 10 (Balanced, good for platforming and dodging)  
  * **STR (Strength):** 10 (Balanced)  
* **Gameplay Focus:** Peter's path will likely involve stealth, infiltration, gadget use, and navigating politically charged environments. His balanced stats allow for versatile gameplay, adapting to various situations.

### **4.2. Sophia**

* **Race:** Angel  
* **Role:** Princess of the Angel  
* **Prototype Stats:**  
  * **ATK (Attack):** 5 (Lower, suggesting less direct combat)  
  * **ITL (Intellect):** 20 (High, indicating magical prowess, wisdom, or diplomatic skills)  
  * **AGI (Agility):** 10 (Balanced)  
  * **STR (Strength):** 5 (Lower)  
* **Gameplay Focus:** Sophia's journey could emphasize magical abilities, support roles, puzzle-solving, and potentially non-violent resolutions. Her high intellect might unlock unique interactions with the environment or NPCs. Perhaps her movement includes gliding or short flights due to her angelic nature.

### **4.3. Kahn**

* **Race:** Demon  
* **Role:** Prince of the Demon  
* **Prototype Stats:**  
  * **ATK (Attack):** 15 (High, indicating strong offensive capabilities)  
  * **ITL (Intellect):** 5 (Lower, suggesting a more direct, brute-force approach)  
  * **AGI (Agility):** 5 (Lower, potentially slower movement or less precise platforming)  
  * **STR (Strength):** 15 (High, suggesting heavy attacks or breaking obstacles)  
* **Gameplay Focus:** Kahn's path will likely focus on aggressive combat, overcoming obstacles through brute force, and perhaps commanding dark powers. His lower agility might mean less emphasis on intricate platforming and more on strategic engagements.
